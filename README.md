# smart-brain-server

It was a full-stack project of ZTM bootcamp, where I built a front-end with Creact React App, a back-end server with express, and a database with PostgreSQL.\
Here is the back-end code source.\
The main challenges here were the API connection and the handleProfile controller (to enable the profile editing feature). To learn more, please refer to [the front-end source code README.md](https://github.com/unhenei/smart-brain/blob/main/README.md).
